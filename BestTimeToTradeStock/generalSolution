T(i, k, 0): the maximum profit at the end of the i-th day with at most k transactions and with 0 stock in our hand AFTER taking the action,
T(i, k, 1): the maximum profit at the end of the i-th day with at most k transactions and with 1 stock in our hand AFTER taking the action. 

A trasaction is a pair of (buy, sell).

Base case:
T(-1, k, 0) = T(i, 0, 0) = 0
T(-1, k, 1) = T(i, 0, 1) = -infty

Recursion:
T(i, k, 0) = max{T(i-1, k, 0), T(i-1, k, 1) + p[i]}   # note that the maximum number of allowable transactions remains the same.
T(i, k, 1) = max{T(i-1, k, 1), T(i-1, k-1, 0) - p[i]} # note that the maximum number of allowable transactions changes by 1.
